## **Project Overview**  
This project explores various **computational theory concepts**, including:  
- **Bitwise operations** for efficient data processing.  
- **Hash functions** for data integrity and security.  
- **SHA256 padding** as per cryptographic standards.  
- **Prime number calculations** used in encryption.  

All tasks are implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook (`tasks.ipynb`)**, with explanations and test cases for verification.
