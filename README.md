## **Project Overview**  
This project explores various **computational theory concepts**, including:  
- **Bitwise operations** for efficient data processing.  
- **Hash functions** for data integrity and security.  
- **SHA256 padding** as per cryptographic standards.  
- **Prime number calculations** used in encryption.  

All tasks are implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook (`tasks.ipynb`)**, with explanations and test cases for verification.

## **Installation** 

**Prerequisites**
Ensure the following software is installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook

1. **Clone the repository:**  
    git clone https://github.com/Cpgeragh/computational_theory_assessment.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    cd computational_theory_assessment

## **Deployment**

This project is executed entirely in a Jupyter Notebook.  

**Running the Notebook**

1. **Run all cells in order using Shift + Enter.**

2. **Alternatively execute the notebook via terminal:**
    jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute tasks.ipynb

3. **Each task produces direct output in the notebook.**
